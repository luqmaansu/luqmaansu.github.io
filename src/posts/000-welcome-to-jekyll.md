Welcome to your new Jekyll blog! This is your first blog post.

Jekyll is a static site generator that's perfect for creating blogs and simple websites. Here are some things you can do:

## Getting Started

- Write posts in Markdown
- Organize content with categories and tags
- Customize the design with CSS
- Deploy easily to GitHub Pages

## Writing Posts

Posts are written in Markdown and stored in the `_posts` directory. The filename format is `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.

You can include code blocks:

```ruby
def hello_world
  puts "Hello, World!"
end
```

And lists:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Enjoy blogging with Jekyll!
